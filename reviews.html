                        <h3>HaiiroTama</h3>
                        <p>The subject of time travel is no stranger to the world of anime, so it takes a lot of work to make a time travel story stand out. For Steins;Gate, that hard work paid off. This is by far the best-executed time travel story that I've ever seen in my experience with anime, and if you haven't seen it yet, you're definitely missing out!
                            <br><br>The story revolves around the antics of Rintarou Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist that goes by the alias "Hououin Kyouma," as he essentially dicks around with time and subsequently deals with the consequences of his selfish actions. I'll be completely honest ...</p>

                        <p>“No one knows what the future holds. That’s why its potential is infinite.”
                            <br><b>Okabe Rintarou (Steins;Gate)</b><br>
                            <br>Such a powerful quote, from an anime at least just as powerful. It’s one of the many wise quotes featured in the excellent time travelling tale called Steins;Gate. It is a story praised by many, and I think the show is definitely worthy of all its praise: it’s an excellent piece of work. Steins;Gate is, in essence, a unique anime. There’s not a single show that I found to be comparable to Steins;Gate.
                            But why does everyone think of Steins;Gate as such a masterpiece?

                        <p>As you may have noticed, Steins;Gate is revered as a masterpiece by most. For those of you who haven't had the privilege of watching this show yet, i'm writing this (belated) review to emphasize just how much you're missing out on.
                            <br><br>First of all, you have to understand that Steins;Gate is completely unique compared to other anime, in terms of story line. Now, with such a complex plot, it would be incredibly easy to mess the series up. Except that they didn't. If they did, it wouldn't a masterpiece. Steins;Gate explores the world of time travelling and time lines, putting in acknowledgements to theories ...

                        <p>Steins;Gate changed my life.

                            <br><br>It completely changed my views about anime, and even life in general.

                            <br><br>'How can an anime change your life?' You must be thinking. 'Is he completely mad?' You must be asking.
                            If you think the above, this is probably because you simply didn't watch Steins;Gate.

                            <br><br>This review will cover my reasons why you should watch Steins;Gate for those who still did not. It will also hype Steins;Gate through the roof for those who already watched it and want another view about the show.

                            <br><br>Alrighty, then. Let's get started.
